How to play
===========
   The game, sometimes called "The Towers
of Hanoi" or some variation of that, is
quite simple.  The leftmost pole begins
with five rings, all of different sizes.
In order to win, all rings must be moved
to the rightmost pole.  To move a ring,
press the number above the pole from
which to take the ring and then the
above the pole on which to place the
ring, then press ENTER to execute the
action.  You can press CLEAR at any time
to clear a command that you have not yet
executed.  If the command is valid, the
top ring will be taken from the pole
whose number was typed first and placed
on the pole whose number was typed last.
However, no ring can be placed on top of
a smaller ring.  By only moving rings to
empty poles or poles containing only
larger rings, attempt to, step-by-step,
move every ring to the rightmost pole.
Upon doing so, you win the game!
